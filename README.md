# DMLQ
Digital Music Library Queries, using PostgreSQL/DB Browser for SQLite
this project is a part of udacity nanodegree program for busniess analyticts

Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
Instructions
You will need to follow the instructions on the next three concepts to get the Chinook database up and running on your own machine, and check that it is set up correctly. There will be two parts to this project.

The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. Though these questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer, they will help you self assess.

The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project. You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer your question. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question. The essentials of your project submission are discussed in the next sections. 
resentations
You are now on the portion of the project you will need to submit to a reviewer. To pass this project follow the below instructions to create a presentation.

Your presentation should include:

Four slides
One visualization per slide
A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
The SQL query used to create the data used in the visualization.

IMPORTANT: This project was made personally from Saad Alhosan, to pass udacity nanodegree program. Udacity does not allow plagrism, read Udacity Honor Code before using any code line.
the project is published for professional resons, and it not by any way a support for cheating and plagrism. However, feel free to contact me if you need any help in the project or understanding the codes.
